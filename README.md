# Emotion-Classification-DNNs



Building on top of the numerous facial emotion detection techniques from recent research, this project demonstrates a state-of-the-art 75.4% accuracy on the FER2013 test set. We experimented with several implementations of deep learning models based on transfer learning for the problem of facial expression recognition (FER). This project was part of Practical Machine Deep Learning Course (Fall 2021) at AUC.
