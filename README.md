# Emotion-Classification-DNNs



Building on top of the numerous facial expression recognition (FER) techniques from recent research, this project demonstrates a state-of-the-art 75.4% accuracy on the FER2013 test set. We have experimented with different pre-trained CNN models like ResNet50, SeNet50 and VGG16 and tried to fine tune them to our emotion classification problem. We have also experimented with the idea of class weighting to counter the problem of class imbalance. Our baseline was a simple CNN model. By combining the output of all the various tries models, we have achieved an accuracy of 75.4\% which is better than the current techniques. This project was part of the Practical Machine Deep Learning Course (Fall 2021) at AUC.
